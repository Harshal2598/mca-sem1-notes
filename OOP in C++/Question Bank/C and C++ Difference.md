# Difference Between C and C++

| **Point** | **C** | **C++** |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **1. Paradigm** | C is a **procedural programming language**. | C++ is a **multi-paradigm language** (Procedural + Object-Oriented). |
| **2. Approach** | Follows a **top-down** approach. | Follows a **bottom-up** approach. |
| **3. OOP Support** | Does **not support OOP** (no classes, no objects). | Supports **OOP concepts** like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism. |
| **4. Data Security** | Uses public data → **less secure**. | Supports **encapsulation** using private/protected members → more secure. |
| **5. Functions** | Function overloading is **not allowed**. | Supports **function & operator overloading**. |
| **6. Memory Management** | Uses `malloc()`, `calloc()`, `free()`. | Uses **new/delete** with constructors & destructors. |
| **7. Standard I/O** | Uses `printf()` and `scanf()`. | Uses **cin, cout** (operator overloaded). |
| **8. Namespace** | No namespace feature. | Has **namespace** to avoid name conflicts. |
| **9. Error Handling** | No built-in exception handling. | Supports **try–catch** exception handling. |
| **10. Inheritance & Polymorphism** | Not supported. | Fully supported. |
| **11. Templates** | Not available. | Supports **templates** (generic programming). |
| **12. File Handling** | Uses `FILE*` structure (C-style). | Supports both C-style and **OOP-style fstream**. |
| **13. Compilation** | Compiled as a **C program only**. | Can compile both **C & C++** style code. |
| **14. Code Reusability** | Limited reusability. | High reusability due to OOP concepts. |
| **15. Compatibility** | C programs run in C++. | C++ programs may **not run** in C. |
| **16. Header Files** | Uses `.h` files like `stdio.h`. | Uses `.h` and `.hpp` (like `iostream`). |
| **17. Inline Functions** | Not available. | Supports **inline functions** for speed. |
| **18. Reference Variables** | Does not support references. | Supports **reference variables** & call-by-reference. |
| **19. Constructors / Destructors** | Not available. | Has **constructors & destructors** for object lifecycle management. |
| **20. Program Structure** | Structured around **functions**. | Structured around **classes & objects**. |
