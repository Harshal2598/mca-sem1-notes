# 🤖 Rationality in Artificial Intelligence (AI)

## 📌 What is Rationality in AI?

**Rationality** in AI refers to the ability of an agent to make the **best possible decision** based on:
- The information it has
- Its goals
- The expected outcomes
- The available actions

A **rational agent** chooses an action that **maximizes performance** and increases its chance of achieving the goal.

## ⭐ Key Points About Rationality

### **1. Rational ≠ Perfect**
A rational agent does not need perfect information.  
It simply needs to choose the *best possible* action using what it knows.

### **2. Depends on Performance Measure**
Rationality is based on:
- Speed  
- Accuracy  
- Safety  
- Profit  
- Comfort  
- Cost  

(Depending on the task).

### **3. Based on Percepts**
A rational agent uses **current and past percepts** to decide what to do next.

### **4. Chooses Actions That Maximize Expected Value**
Actions are selected based on the **highest expected utility**.

### **5. Rationality ≠ Omniscience**
The agent does NOT know everything; it only uses available knowledge effectively.

## 🧠 Example of Rational Agent

### **Self-Driving Car**
- Percepts → road, traffic, weather  
- Goal → reach safely & quickly  
- Rational Action → slow down in rain, avoid collisions, take shortest route  

It chooses *best possible* action, not necessarily perfect action.
