---

# 💡 **4. Early AI Programs (1956–1970)**

### **• 1957 — Perceptron (Frank Rosenblatt)**
- First machine learning model (simple neural network).

### **• 1958 — LISP Language**
- Created by John McCarthy, used for AI programming.

### **• 1965–1970 — ELIZA**
- First natural language AI chatbot (Joseph Weizenbaum).

---

# 📉 **5. First AI Winter (1974–1980)**

- Funding dropped due to **limited computing power**.  
- AI progress slowed.

---

# 📈 **6. Expert Systems Era (1980–1987)**

- AI industry faced another decline.

---

# ⚡ **8. Rise of Modern AI (1993–2010)**

### **• 1997 — IBM Deep Blue**
- Defeated world chess champion **Garry Kasparov**.  
- Landmark in AI reasoning.

### **• 2002 — Consumer Robots**
- iRobot Roomba introduced → AI enters home use.

### **• 2006 — Deep Learning coined**
- Term **“Deep Learning”** introduced by Geoffrey Hinton.

---

# 🤯 **9. AI Explosion (2010–Present)**

### **• 2011 — IBM Watson**
- Won *Jeopardy!* beating human champions.

### **• 2012 — ImageNet Breakthrough**
